# tradeDispenser

tradeDispenser is an addon made for lazy mages. It allows to automatically trade any water or food you have in your bags.

You can take this configuration as a basic reference (CTRL-click to have a full size view in a new tab) :

This is what every class will get from each trade :
- Rogues / Warriors: 20 x Conjured Cinnamon Roll
- Druids / Paladins / Priests : 40 x Conjured Crystal Water
- Mages / Hunters : 20 x Conjured Crystal Water
- Warlocks : 20 x Conjured Crystal Water & 20 x Conjured Cinnamon Roll

You can set it up differently if it doesn't suit your needs.

## FAQ

1. With this automation, can't it be considered as botting ?

The only thing that can be bannable is if you try to abuse from this addon (for example by doing gold from automatic trades). The addon uses the functions AcceptTrade() & CancelTrade() that could perfectly be used in macros. There is absolutely no reason people can get banned only using this addon : the behaviour is the reason people can get banned.
